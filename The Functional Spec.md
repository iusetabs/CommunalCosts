 We aim to develop an **easy to use**, **efficient** application which makes life easier for those who manage communal costs. Our app will **keep track** of the **incomings and outgoings** for a **household**, a **club/society** or a **campaign/fundraiser**, while also providing **financial advice** on the data submitted. We will focus on **transforming users data** into more accessible forms, providing users with a **safe and secure way** of storing financial data, and offering very **convenient** ways of entering user **input**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 End-Users can **create an account** of their own, and subsequently **create** or **join** a “**collective**” of a certain **type**. Each varies according to key differences in both **structure** and user **privileges**. Collectives can be split into three **types** - a **household**, a **club/society** or a **campaign/fundraiser**, along with the possibility of **creating** your own collective, if the provided collectives do not meet your needs. These types vary according to the **levels** of **access** given to members, to access and alter the group’s finances. Upon creation of a “collective” a **unique ID** is created to allow others to join.                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 Each collective has **three** different “member types”, **administrators**, **contributors** and **ordinary members**. Administrators have **control** over the entire collective, contributors can only make entries and ordinary members can only view the expenses. All members can query any entry.

 What separates our app from what’s already on the market is, that while there are other financial applications out there that offer the ability to send or receive payments, or that deal with a **very specific** purpose such as splitting bills there are very few exhaustive applications that offer a **wide range** of financial services. As a result of amalgamating a number of features and offering some new ones e.g. **pdf scraping** as an input method. application.

 The possible business applications arising from this application are **advertising** and **marketing** the app on the android app store. We could include in app advertising possibly as a discrete **banner** at the bottom of the app or a **popup ad** underneath some of the product’s data **visualisation**, with the aim of not being too **obstructive** so as to discourage use. We could then possibly introduce a paid or subscription **service** to remove adds and introduce **greater functionality** if there is a demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 We could also sell the app as a **paid** application on the android app store.

This can be tailored to their financial situation and goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 **A variety of income and expenditure data entry methods** - we will include many different data entry methods, to ensure that it is convenient for users to enter data and keep their financial records up to date. We will allow users to submit a **bank statement** pdf, from which the application will then record the available financial data from it. This file **will not be stored** on the database, it will only be used to extrapolate information from. A **receipt scanner** is another input method, allowing users to specify how much was spent towards the collective and the scanner will then gather the rest of the financial data from the receipt, ignoring irrelevant information. While the image itself also acts as **proof** of financial expenditure as well as a **convenient** method for entering user’s financial data.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 **Have confidence in the security and encryption of their data** - we want users to be confident, that at every layer of the design process, the safety of their data has been given the utmost consideration and only the most secure design methods have been chosen. For example, we chose to develop with the google app engine as it handled some of the more abstract security concerns, allowing us to focus on more important features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 **Alert the user, to modifications to the collective and expected modifications if absent** - to implement an app alert system, that operates through a combination of push notifications and an in app notification centre. While alerting users to changes it will also remind the user of expected changes, eg expenses that haven’t been logged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 **Offer advice on taxation and other financial advice, relevant to the user’s current financial position** - we aim to find reliable resources to scrape current financial information, e.g. we are currently in contact with revenue to see if they have an api that we could use and alert users to events that affect their financial situation. This should also cover advice on tax brackets, expected tax due in comparison to paid so far, at the year’s end and advice of any purchases for which tax can be claimed back or tax credits that are applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 **Set financial goals** - we will allow users and collectives to work towards financial goals, both concrete and abstract. For example, a concrete goal: to save x euro or an abstract goal: to save more. The abstract version would then report the percentage change in savings during the designated period. Rather than relevant to a goal position the focus is relative to the starting position.

 The app **aims to target the student population** specifically, as we see this as a population with a need to budget. Societies, shared accommodation, and so on all provide ample opportunities for use of this app. We don’t foresee any particular technical challenges with users in this area as students tend to be a fairly technically proficient demographic. The main concern would be that the **U.I. is user friendly** enough so as to be **intuitive** and not cause confusion. As a result, our focus is to have a clear and simple U.I. with only a few options at each stage and a further create your own option for users that would like to delve further into the options that the app can provide.

 **Upon opening the application, you will be **prompted** to either create an account or login with an existing account. We hope to enable users to login with existing accounts, e.g. facebook, **google play account**, an email account, or to manually enter their data and create an account. We should only require a name, email address and a collective to join or create. Once an account has been set up, the user will receive a confirmation email with a link to verify their email address which once completed will full establish their user account.

 **After purchasing goods for the group, a picture of the receipt can be taken as both **proof** of purchase and a **source** of financial **information**. With the option to specify which of the goods purchased were specifically for the **group** and which were **personal** items. Another way of entering a substantial amount of financial data at once is to allow the app to access a **pdf** of your **bank statement** on your phone and it will scrape the applicable financial information from the document. Then offering the user the opportunity to **accept** or **reject** to add individual transactions from the bank statement.

 **Users will be able to view both, **summary** and **individual** transaction data. Once an account reaches a point where enough information is available summary **data analysis** will be carried out. Providing users with a quick view of the whole group’s finances. However up until that point we will still provide basic summary features that do not rely on a wealth of information e.g. transactions since a certain date, or on a certain date, average cost of expenses so far. Users will also be able to view individual transaction entries and query them.

 We wish to develop a sleek, seamless application. One which users do not notice any loading times or have to wait to update details. As such, we would hope to possibly **duplicate** critical data locally on user’s devices so as to avoid a heavy reliance on an active data connection. Possibly also having the app update as much information as possible while at the introductory screen so that necessary information is loaded without explicitly stating it. Therefore alleviating wait times at points which they would generally be encountered e.g. when later viewing collective information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 Since the app deals with sensitive financial information, security will be of paramount concern at each and every point of the design. To ensure that at no level users are vulnerable to their financial data being accessed by those without the given access. So far we have factored that into the our choice of database and framework to design our database.

Which could then lead to **data loses** if a key user removes the app or there is some hardware error.

 *The use of external login sources will add extra **complexity**, especially if there are quite a few to implement. However from our research, it seems clear that most of this work will be handled by **API’s** from the various login sources. Creating a **database** of **user emails** and passwords for those that choose that account setup method will be simple.

 *This is another pillar of our application without convenient ways to enter data it will deter users from entering financial information. If we left it to manual data entry, it would be unlikely that users would enter enough data for this app to offer detailed financial advice. Instead we focus on alternative methods such as **analysing** bank statement pdfs and **image processing** i.e. receipts. This should make the application a **convenient** alternative to manually keeping track of financial information.

 *This is another mission **critical** function. Without it, it will be a major barrier to user uptake and as such the app won’t be used.

 This will be one of if not the most technically demanding aspects of the project.

 *Having a way of **reminding** users of their financial commitments and perhaps offering financial advice to help them towards their financial goals would be a very **useful** feature. For example, if there is a pattern of input over a certain period and one week there is no input, the app would alert the user to this fact, we plan to offer an explicit and implicit version. The implicit version operates on the basis of usual input patterns. While the explicit is implemented when the user sets a reminder for this specific event. This will be carried out through developing functions on the backend and the frontend.

 This is not an overly critical feature however it would be a **nice feature** to see implemented in a finished application. Without it the app would lack the desired feedback and user encouragement.

 Figure 4.1 shows an **overview** of the system architecture: the end user, the **android user-interface** where the end-user will be able to access and **edit collectives securely**. Our app will be developed with the **Google App Engine** so we will develop **python scripts** here to query the Database and process the information which will then be sent out to all users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 There are quite a few advantages of using **Firebase** and **Google App Engine**, especially when it comes to **google accounts**. The Google App Engine and Firebase also implement **sandboxing** which is quite good for us as it ensures the environment is secure which is of the utmost importance for us and our users.

 The google app engine is a **cloud based hosting environment** for our backend. We plan to implement this with **Python**. The app will be **sandboxed** here for security reasons and will always run as it runs on cloud **IaaS**. It will perform operations on the data which it receives from Firebase which will then **sync** it across **all devices**.

 Below is the **context diagram** (figure 5.1) which shows the top level design of our system.

 Our **tasklist** is split into 3 main sections, the *Preliminary Deliverables*, the *Development stage* and The *final stretch*. The development stage contains 4 main prototypes, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and the Final stage, along with testing stages for each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 At first, the focus will be on getting our backend up and running and ensuing **secure communication** between the elements of the backend and the backend-frontend connection.

 The **GANTT diagram** shows tasks line by line and shows the relation to it’s predecessors through a black arrow. These tasks can only start once the predecessor has been completed. The gray bars represent the timeline of the three main sections. *See **Fig 6.2** below. *
